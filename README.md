# Dota 2 Custom Announcer (Pick Me Announcer)

Simple client-side script that replaces the default Dota 2 announcer with a custom one.

## Installation

1. Put the `announcer.lua` file into:
   `Ваш диск:\Папка чита\scripts`
2. Go to your Dota 2 folder:
   `...\dota 2 beta\game\dota\sounds`
3. Create a folder called `pick_me_announcer` and unpack all sound files into it.
4. Launch Dota 2 with your software and **enable client-side scripts (ВСО)** in the settings.

After that the game will use the custom announcer sounds instead of the default ones.
